### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays objects like `Person`, `CCA`, and `Reminder` residing in their respective `Model`s.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletep 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletep 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
****

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person`, `Cca`, and `Reminder` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList`, `UniqueCcaList`, `UniqueReminderList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person`, `Cca`, and `Reminder` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`, `ObservableList<Cca>`, and `ObservableList<Reminder>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Storage

The current Storage mechanism is split into two main sections: `AddressBook` storage, for all ePoch-related data, and `UserPrefs` storage, for all user preference-related data.
Whenever ePoch needs to save or update its storage, it converts the relevant object into a `.json` object with the `saveJsonFile` method in `jsonUtil`.

There are three main classes types in ePoch that need to be saved: `Person`, `Cca`, and `Reminder`. Each of these classes is converted to its corresponding `JsonAdapted` class,
to be made suitable for `.json` conversion. Because each `Cca` object contains a `Set` of `Person`s and `Reminder`s as members, `JsonAdaptedPerson` and `JsonAdaptedReminder` will be stored within `JsonAdaptedCca` as well.

Alternatives considered: instead of storing whole `Person` and `Reminder` objects in `Cca` objects, the alternative of storing unique identifiers for them `Pid`, `Rid` etc was considered. In the end, this possibility was rejected
because of how time-consuming refactoring the entire project to use this new system would be. 

### CCAs

A CCA has:

* A CCA name, represented by the `CcaName` class. CCA name must be unique.
* Zero or more people enrolled in it, represented by the HashSet `members`.
* Zero or more reminders associated with it, represented by the HashSet `reminders`.

Two CCAs are considered identical if they have the same name.

#### Command for Adding CCAs

The `addc` command is implemented by `CcaAddCommand`, which extends `Command`.
Polymorphism allows the different Command objects to be passed around and executed without having to know what type of Command it is.

#### Command for Deleting CCAs

The `deletec` command is implemented by `CcaDeleteCommand`.
Similar to `CcaAddCommand`, `CcaDeleteCommand` extends `Command` to practice polymorphism.

The `CcaDeleteCommand` class has an Index which is the index of the CCA to delete, specified by the user.
It implements the `execute` method which handles the logic of the delete command.
The `getFilteredCcaList` method is called to obtain a List of CCAs, `lastShownList`.
If the given index exists in `lastShownList`, the corresponding CCA is deleted using the `deleteCca` method defined in the `ModelManager`.

#### Command for Finding CCAs

The `findc` command is implemented by `CcaFindCommand` which extends `Command`.

The keywords specified by the user are passed as a List to the `CcaNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` constructor.
The `CcaNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` class extends `Predicate<Cca>` and implements the `test` method,
which uses streams to filter CCAs whose name matches any of the keywords.

#### Command for Enrolling Person into CCAs

The `enrol` command is implemented by `CcaEnrolCommand` which extends `Command`.

The `CcaEnrolCommand` class has two Indexes, the index of the CCA to be enrolled into, and the index of the Person to enrol, specified by the user.
It implements the `execute` method which handles the logic of the enrol command.
The `getFilteredCcaList` and `getFilteredPersonList` method is called to obtain a List of CCAs and Persons, `lastShownCcaList` and `lastShownPersonList` respectively.
If the gives Indexes exist in `lastShownCcaList` and `lastShownPersonList`, the corresponding Person is enrolled into the corresponding CCA using the `enrolPersonIntoCca` method defined in the `ModelManager`.

#### Command for Expelling Person from CCAs

The `expel` command is implemented by `CcaExpelCommand` which extends `Command`.

The `CcaExpelCommand` class has two Indexes, the index of the CCA to be expelled from, and the index of the Person to expel, specified by the user.
It implements the `execute` method which handles the logic of the expel command.
The `getFilteredCcaList` and `getFilteredPersonList` method is called to obtain a List of CCAs and Persons, `lastShownCcaList` and `lastShownPersonList` respectively.
If the gives Indexes exist in `lastShownCcaList` and `lastShownPersonList`, the corresponding Person is expelled from the corresponding CCA using the `expelPersonFromCca` method defined in the `ModelManager`.

### Reminders

A Reminder has:

* A reminder name, represented by the `ReminderName` class.
* A start date, represented by the `ReminderStartDate` class.
* Zero or one frequency, represented by the `ReminderFrequency` class and making use of enumerations from the `Frequency` class.
* Zero or one occurrence, represented by the `ReminderOccurrence` class.
* Exactly one CCA that it is linked to, represented as a `Cca` data field.

Two Reminders are considered identical if they have the same name, same frequency, and same occurrence.

#### Command for Adding Reminders

The `addr` command is implemented by `ReminderAddCommand`, which extends `Command`.
Polymorphism allows the different Command objects to be passed around and executed without having to know what type of Command it is.

If the user does not specify a frequency and occurrence, the frequency defaults to a One-off frequency and the occurrence defaults to 1 (since we take it that the Reminder only occurs once).
If the user specifies only one of frequency and occurrence, then an error is thrown.

The `ReminderAddCommand` class has an Index which is the index of the CCA to add the Reminder to, specified by the user.
It implements the `execute` method which handles the logic of the add command.
The `updateFilteredCcaList` and `updateFilteredReminderList` methods are called to update the `UI` component.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `deletep 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `deletep` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `deletep 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `addp n/David â€¦` to add a new person. The `addp` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deletep`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* has many contacts that are spread across different CCAs
* needs to keep track of many recurring reminders associated with each CCA

**Value proposition**:

ePoch helps overcommitted students keep track of their many contacts and events across various CCAs.
