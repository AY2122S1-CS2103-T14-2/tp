### Project: ePoch

ePoch is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It has been designed for the busy NUS student, allowing the user to create contacts for persons and to create CCAs; link those persons and CCAs together; and to create periodic reminders for those CCAs.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
