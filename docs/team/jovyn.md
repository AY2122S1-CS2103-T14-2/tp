### Project: ePoch

ePoch helps overcommitted students keep track of their many contacts and events across various CCAs.
The product allows students to link persons with CCAs and set reminders that repeat over a given time interval, to conveniently organise their commitments and overlapping social circles.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
